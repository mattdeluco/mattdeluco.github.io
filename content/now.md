## Career
### #opentowork
I am seeking new roles in Engineering Management! [Please visit my
LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdeluco/), or
[reach out directly](mailto:matt@deluco.net) if you're hiring!

### Sr. Manager, Engineering - Docker Inc.
Most recently (May 2022 - Oct 2024) I was working as
Senior Manager, Engineering (Billing) at [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

I managed a team of 8 engineers from Intermediate to Principal, and worked
with a Product Manager, Technical Project Manager, and Designer.

We managed the systems that sustained over $30MM annually in SaaS subscriptions
and over $100MM anually in inside-sales deals. Our projects included migrating
those subscriptions to a new Billing provider (Stripe) and integrating new products
and acquisitions to take Docker from single to multi-product.

## Home

## Project
ðŸš§ Personal Financial Planning SaaS Project ðŸš§

In what little spare time I have, I spend it building a personal finance web application.
I want people to gain a better understanding of their finances and be better able to set
financial goals.
