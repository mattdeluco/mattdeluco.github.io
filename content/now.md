## Career
I work at [Connected](https://connected.io) as an Engineering Manager with four great reports.

- Web launched in Dec. 2021, mobile apps published in early 2022
- Backend: AWS Amplify, GraphQL, Lambda (Javascript), DynamoDB
- Web: React (Typescript)
- Mobile: React-Native (Javascript)

## Project
ðŸš§ Personal Financial Planning SaaS Project ðŸš§

In what little spare time I have, I spend it building a personal finance web application.
I want people to gain a better understanding of their finances and be better able to set
financial goals.
