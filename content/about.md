## Interests

### Cycling

For a period of my life I dedicated a considerable amount of time and energy to
competitive road cycling, at one point moving to Port Moody, BC to train
year-round on the road and track.

I cut my teeth on road cycling among the incredible road racing community in
Ottawa, Ontario. I regularly attended the Tuesday night criteriums, Thursday
night time-trials on Aviation Parkway, and Saturday morning Carp loops, along
with many, many, many loops in Gatineau Park.

It was living in Port Moody that I discovered track cycling, not
far away at the Burnaby Velodrome where I worked as a mechanic in exchange for
track access, training, and racing. My move to Toronto many years later
coincided with the opening of the [Mattamy National Cycling Centre](https://www.milton.ca/en/arts-and-recreation/mattamy-national-cycling-centre.aspx)
for the [2015 Pan-Am Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Pan_American_Games)
(where I volunteered as a co-ordinator on the field-of-play) - the MNCC is an
incredible facility. I trained and raced at the MNCC intensely for around 3
years, specializing as a sprinter (flying 200, match sprint, kierin, kilo) - an
incredible outlet and absolutely thrilling experience.

With far less time to maintain my former fitness, I have since become a more
recreactonal cyclist and have rediscovered mountain biking. Most of my time on
two wheels is now spent in Toronto's Don Valley, and on the trails of
Mont-Tremblant.

### Skiing

I grew up alpine ski racing with the Sault Ski Runners (aka Searchmont Ski
Runners) north of the Sault at Searchmont Ski Resort. I spent years racing
across Northern Ontario and ultimately spent a year racing at the FIS level with
the Northern Ontario Division (NOD) ski team.

I've since picked up cross country skiing (skating, occsionally classic) that
was initially a great way to cross train for cycling during Canadian winters.
Now it's just another means of staying fit.

As a recreational skiier I try to occasionally find my way out west to bigger
mountains. While I love being up to my eyeballs shreddin' the gnar, timing
weather is impossible, so I find great pleasure in carving high-speed turns on
nice corduroy.
