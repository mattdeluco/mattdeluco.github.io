ðŸš§ Personal Financial Planning SaaS Project ðŸš§

{{< tweet 1381814633951072257 >}}

Follow me and my long-lived [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/MattDeLuco/status/1381814633951072257)
where I post updates to the project as they happen!

## Database
- PostgreSQL

The primary focus of this project is the database - after all, I believe data *is* the application.

Having forgotten my high school accounting education, my original personal finances spreadsheet was
an approximation of double entry accounting. Each line in the transactions table consisted of a bank
account, a category, and optionally a sub-category.

When it came time to formalize my implementation (build this app) I rediscovered double entry accounting
as a means of categorizing transactions. And so I set out to model double entry accounting in PostgreSQL,
with an added feature: an API to the database, written natively in the database using PL/PGSQL, to
abstract the underlying model.

### API

## Backend
- Nodejs
- Details soon...

## Frontend
- Vuejs

## Competition
The following are a list of similar applications to serve as reference and inspiration.
