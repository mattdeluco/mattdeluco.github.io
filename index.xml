&lt;p>Forged in the fire &amp;amp; ice of Northern Ontario, this wayward soul has lived vicariously through himself in such endeavours as downhill ski racing, triathlons, and road, track, and mountain cycling. Having seen enough of the world to be indifferent to the rest, his heart was captured by a laugh, a smile, and a soul he could not fathom living without.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Loving husband and father, skier, cyclist, software engineering (manager)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I grew up in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and have since lived in Ottawa,
Port Moody, BC (briefly), and now reside in Toronto.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="interests">Interests&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="cycling">Cycling&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For a period of my life I dedicated a considerable amount of time and energy to
competitive road cycling, at one point moving to Port Moody, BC to train
year-round on the road and track.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cut my teeth on road cycling among the incredible road racing community in
Ottawa, Ontario. I regularly attended the Tuesday night criteriums, Thursday
night time-trials on Aviation Parkway, and Saturday morning Carp loops, along
with many, many, many loops in Gatineau Park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was living in Port Moody that I discovered track cycling, not
far away at the Burnaby Velodrome where I worked as a mechanic in exchange for
track access, training, and racing. My move to Toronto many years later
coincided with the opening of the &lt;a href="https://www.milton.ca/en/arts-and-recreation/mattamy-national-cycling-centre.aspx">Mattamy National Cycling Centre&lt;/a>
for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Pan_American_Games">2015 Pan-Am Games&lt;/a>
(where I volunteered as a coordinator on the field-of-play) - the MNCC is an
incredible facility. I trained and raced at the MNCC intensely for around 3
years, specializing as a sprinter (flying 200, match sprint, kierin, kilo) - an
incredible outlet and absolutely thrilling experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With far less time to maintain my former fitness, I have since become a more
recreational cyclist and have rediscovered mountain biking. Most of my time on
two wheels is now spent in Toronto&amp;rsquo;s Don Valley and on the trails of
Mont-Tremblant, QC.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Former Cat 2 competitive road cyclist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Former Masters track cyclist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Current recreational road and mountain biker&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="skiing">Skiing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I grew up alpine ski racing with the Sault Ski Runners (aka Searchmont Ski
Runners) north of the Sault at &lt;a href="http://www.searchmont.com">Searchmont Ski Resort&lt;/a>. I spent many years racing
across Northern Ontario and ultimately spent a year racing at the FIS level with
the Northern Ontario Division (NOD) ski team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve since picked up cross country skiing (skating, occasionally classic) that
was initially a great way to cross train for cycling during Canadian winters.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s just another means of staying fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a recreational skier I try to occasionally find my way out west to bigger
mountains. While I love being up to my eyeballs shreddin&amp;rsquo; the gnar, timing
weather is impossible, so I find great pleasure in carving high-speed turns on
nice corduroy.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚧 Personal Financial Planning SaaS Project 🚧&lt;br>&lt;br>This project started with a spreadsheet Christmas 2011. I have 11 years of meticulously organized personal financial data; excel just doesn&amp;#39;t cut it anymore.&lt;br>&lt;br>This isn&amp;#39;t the first such app, probably not the last, but it&amp;#39;s mine. 👇&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Matt DeLuco (@MattDeLuco) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattDeLuco/status/1381814633951072257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2021&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Follow me and my long-lived &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattDeLuco/status/1381814633951072257">Twitter Thread&lt;/a>
where I post updates to the project as they happen!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="database">Database&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>PostgreSQL&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heavy on: normalization, triggers, sql and pl/pgsql functions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The primary focus of this project is the database - after all, I believe data &lt;em>is&lt;/em> the application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having forgotten my high school accounting education, my original personal finances spreadsheet was
an approximation of double entry accounting. Each line in the transactions table consisted of a bank
account, a category, and optionally a sub-category - each of these could be considered a &amp;ldquo;T account&amp;rdquo;.
Where I diverged from double-entry accounting is that each transaction was represented only by a single
entry - one line recording both debits and credits:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Tue, Apr 29, 2014 | VISA | Starbucks | ($2.78) | Dining | Coffee&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When it came time to formalize my implementation (build this app) I rediscovered double entry accounting
as a means of categorizing transactions. And so I set out to model double entry accounting in PostgreSQL,
with an added feature: an API to the database, written natively in the database using PL/PGSQL, to
abstract the underlying model. This API would accept JSON as input and return JSON as output and requires
little intervention from the backend (session management and adding auth info to the SQL API payload.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The example below is the double-entry version of the example above (in the database, some normalization
takes place.) A credit is applied to increase the liability account (VISA) while a debit is applied to
increase the expense account (Dining/Coffee):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Tue, Apr 29, 2014 | Starbucks | $2.78 | CR | VISA |
Tue, Apr 29, 2014 | Starbucks | $2.78 | DR | Dining | Coffee
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h3 id="sql-api">SQL API&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t recall from where I got this idea, but I wanted to try building a database with a &amp;ldquo;native API&amp;rdquo; -
which is to say, an API to the database on the database built with sql and the included procedural language.
This is &lt;a href="https://sive.rs/pg">not a new&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1440406931080843271?s=21">original idea&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe strongly that a database should be designed with data integrity in mind, and one of the means of
maintaining integrity is to define the ways in which it is possible to interact with the database. It
should not be necessary to rebuild this API in each client that wishes to interact with the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further, with the &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/datatype-json.html">advent of JSON&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-json.html">in PostgreSQL&lt;/a>
I thought it would be novel to create a typical CRUD API with JSON inputs and outputs, similar to a REST
API. The backend webserver then becomes an HTTP proxy to the database, responsible for session management
but otherwise passing JSON (i.e. &lt;em>data&lt;/em>) from the frontend directly to the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are five schemas in the database each with at least the four basic CRUD operations. These are written
in a combination of sql and plpgsql functions, many using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to query the JSON
and do one or more actions as a result (e.g. INSERT or UPDATE.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="json">JSON&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The following is a small example of how JSON is used in this database - a function that updates a journal entry:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION journal.update_journal(in_json JSON)
RETURNS JSON
AS $$
WITH results AS (
UPDATE journal.journal j SET
transaction_date=x.transaction_date,
posted_date=x.posted_date,
description=x.description
FROM json_populate_recordset(null::journal.journal, in_json-&amp;gt;&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;) as x
WHERE
j.client_id = (in_json#&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;#39;{context, client_id}&amp;#39;)::BIGINT
AND j.id = x.id
RETURNING j.id
) SELECT json_agg(r) FROM results r;
$$ LANGUAGE sql;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Taking advantage of Postgres&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-json.html">JSON Functions and Operators&lt;/a>
it&amp;rsquo;s possible to reference various properties of the JSON input. For example, &lt;code>in_json#&amp;gt;&amp;gt;'{context, client_id}'&lt;/code> extracts
a value from this structure:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>{
&amp;#34;context&amp;#34;: {
&amp;#34;client_id&amp;#34;: 1234
},
&amp;#34;data&amp;#34;: [...]
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>While &lt;code>json_populate_recordset(null::journal.journal, in_json-&amp;gt;'data')&lt;/code> expands the data array
property into a set of rows whose type is that of the journal schema&amp;rsquo;s journal table (so matching
the column types to the corresponding JSON properties for each array element.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pgtap">pgtap&lt;/h3>

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theory">David E. Wheeler&lt;/a> is a tool for unit testing databases. It is
used extensively throughout this project to validate the functionality of the API described
earlier with 16 test suites and over 150 unit tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following is an example of the test output for a suite that verifies the functionality of
the &lt;code>journal.add_split()&lt;/code> API:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code> # Subtest: tests.test_journal_split_transaction()
ok 1 - Create split transaction - groceries/household from chequing
ok 2 - Create split transaction - groceries/household from chequing/visa
